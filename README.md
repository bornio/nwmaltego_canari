=================================================================

Author: David Bressler (@bostonlink)

## 1.0 - About

nwmaltego_canari is a port of the NWmaltego project into a canari framework package.  The reason for the port is to
make installing, using, and modifying the nwmaltego transforms much easier.  The Canari framework is a Maltego local
transform framework created for rapid development and deployment of Maltego transforms.

The NWmaltego project is a project that integrates searching Netwitness network session metadata into Maltego transforms.
The project is used to graphically map out network investigations within netwitness to a Maltego graph.  This helps,
security teams, investigators, incident responders, etc.
